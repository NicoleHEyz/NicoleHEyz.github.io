## About Me
<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, -->
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/en/szjyry/3594.html" target="_blank"> Meng Zhou</a>. My doctoral research focuses on the energetics of subpolar circulation and the processes of water mass transport in the Antarctic. I am deeply interested in the mechanisms and implications of extreme events under the climate change background. My research involves analyzing and discussing these phenomena based on both observational data and model results.

Transitioning from a background in Geology to Physical Oceanography, I have expanded my perspective from long-term geological scientific stories to the theoretical knowledge of geophysical fluid dynamics. This interdisciplinary experience has equipped me with a comprehensive view of both Earth system science and local ocean dynamic processes.

## Projects
- **[Nov.2022-present]** **Energy Transformation Processes of Subpolar Circulation and Water Masses in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean**    
Energetics analysis for an anomalous event of strong EKE anomalies observed in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, providing regional patterns of energy and characteristics of energy transformation.  
Amis to reveal the governing mechanisms behind the extreme event by analyzing the causes of EKE anomalies and their associated anomalous poleward transport of Circumpolar Deep Water, quantifying the role of eddies.  
Seeks to explore dynamic processes involved in deep water transport, as well as potential connections with climate variability and oceanic changes.
