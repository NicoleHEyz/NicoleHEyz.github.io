## About Me
<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, -->
I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Marine Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/en/szjyry/3594.html" target="_blank"> Meng Zhou</a>. My doctoral research focuses on the energetics of subpolar circulation and the processes of water mass transport in the Antarctic. I am deeply interested in the mechanisms and implications of extreme events under the climate change background. My research involves analyzing and discussing these phenomena based on both observational data and model results.

Transitioning from a background in Geology to Physical Oceanography, I have expanded my perspective from long-term geological scientific stories to the theoretical knowledge of geophysical fluid dynamics. This interdisciplinary experience has equipped me with a comprehensive view of both Earth system science and local ocean dynamic processes.

## Projects
- **[Mar. 2021-Jun. 2021]** **Undergraduate Thesis Project**, Tongji University
Individual Project “Surface Mean Currents and Eddy Kinetic Energy of the Adjacent Cosmonauts Sea Region, East Antarctica”, instructed by Prof. Meng Zhou and Prof. Yanwei Zhang.
 
Analyzed regional surface mean currents and eddy kinetic energy variations based on surface drifters, satellite altimetry, and reanalysis data.

***Excellent Graduation Thesis of Tongji University in 2021***</a>

- **[Mar. 2019-Mar. 2021]** **Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**, Tongji University
Led the Program "Effect of Seasonal Strong Wind Field on Submarine Seismic Signals in the Northern South China Sea", instructed by Prof. Zhang Yanwei.

Concluded anomalous variation of submarine seismic signals trigged by typhoons and tides.

Provided a processing method of long-term observation from seafloor stations.

***Shanghai Innovation Project Award***
