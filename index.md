working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QtyFQVYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Thaddeus Tarpey</a>. My research involves developing statistical models that cater to high-dimensional complex data, such as functional and imaging data. This endeavor confronts two main challenges: First, how to define a metric with self-consistent property to cluster a population into subgroups, based on rich and complex tensor data for each individual. Second, how to develop a semi-supervised clustering algorithm, directed by a specific label, to accurately identify subgroups that align closely with a target subgroup of interest.
